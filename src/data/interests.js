Taking daily pictures has helped me discover hidden gems both at home and during my travels, capturing everything from small details to big moments. It’s been amazing to find beauty in the ordinary, whether I’m at home or exploring somewhere new. Each photo is a new opportunity to see the world differently.',

There’s something magical about sitting in a theater, whether I’m lost in a small, grounded indie film or immersed in a big cinematic experience in Dolby Digital or IMAX. I love the feeling of being transported into another world, especially when it’s shared with others. It’s the perfect mix of personal escape and collective experience that makes the movies such a special place for me.',

        description: `I’m totally hooked on reading—whether it’s an addicting page-turner from Stephen King or a deeply personal nonfiction work by writers like James Baldwin, Kiese Laymon, or Bell Hooks. I love getting lost in stories that challenge and inspire, and there's nothing like the raw honesty in their words. I’m also a huge fan of comics, especially those by Brian K Vaughan or Tom King; they always pull me in with their creativity and depth. Each book, no matter the genre, feels like a new adventure.`,

I love exploring new states, discovering hidden gems, and finding the best local restaurants along the way. Some of my favorite domestic spots are Chicago, Portland, and Los Angeles, each with its own vibe and charm. I’ve been as far as Spain, and I’m hoping to keep expanding my horizons with more international adventures in the future. There's always something new to discover and I can't wait to see where my travels take me next.`,

Whether it’s the electrifying atmosphere or the sheer spectacle of the performers, I love getting lost in the moment. I try to hit up shows at least once a month and make it to a festival every year. Some of my favorite performances have been by Tyler the Creator, Paul McCartney, SiR, and Ari Lennox—each one unforgettable in its own way. There’s nothing like that shared excitement and connection with the crowd.`,

        description: `I didn’t really get into sports until my 30s, but watching Angel Reese’s rookie year in the WNBA completely hooked me. The culture around women’s sports feels so much more inclusive and wholesome compared to the often intense vibe in mainstream sports. I love traveling to different cities to catch teams play in their hometowns, but when I’m not on the road, I try to catch every game from home. There’s something special about the energy and the community in women’s sports that makes it all feel more personal and exciting.`,

        description: `Video games have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. Some of my best memories are from sitting on the couch with friends and family, playing Nintendo and just having a blast together. As I got older, I started gravitating more towards narrative-driven single-player games that tell amazing stories, but I also love diving into online multiplayer experiences where I can team up with friends across the country. Gaming has always been a way to connect, unwind, and get lost in different worlds.`,

        description: `I’ve always loved board games and card games—the joy of gathering around a table with others and getting lost in the competition and camaraderie is something truly special. Whether it’s a classic game of Spades, a quick round of Uno, the strategy of Catan, or even something more immersive like Dungeons & Dragons, the in-person experience of playing together is what makes it so magical. There’s just something about that shared energy and laughter that makes every game memorable.`,
